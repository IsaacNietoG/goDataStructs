# Data Structures in GoLang

In this repository you can find Golang implementations of all the data structures and exercises covered in the book "Estructuras de Datos con Java Moderno", written by Canek Pel√°ez Valdez.

The objective of this work is to adapt the ideas and concepts of this book to the idiomatic characteristics of Go, offering clean, efficient and well-documented code.

This is not a direct translation of the book but a reinterpretation of their concepts using the traits and features of Go

## Implemented:

## To be implemented:
- AVL Trees
- Complete Binary Trees
- Ordered Binary Trees
- RB-trees
- Utilities related to arrays
- Queues
- Stacks
- Dictionaries (with some hash functions)
- Sets
- Graphs
- Linked Lists
- Binary Heaps
- Fenwick Trees (this is not included in the book but I want to study them)
- Segment Trees (idem)
